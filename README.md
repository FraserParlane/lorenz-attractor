# Weather and chaos: How well can we predict the future?

In the 1960s, Ed Lorenz tried to create a basic computer simulation of the earth's atmosphere. He discovered that a slight perturbation in the starting condition of his model would result in a completely different weather prediction after only a few iterations. Lorenz had discovered **sensitive dependence on initial conditions**: systems can be deterministic, but completely unpredictable.

Below is a visualization of the three dimensions of Lorenz' weather model. Five replicates of the system are initialized with very slight differences in starting conditions. [Learn more about the Lorenz system](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Lorenz_system).
